# Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

The shows how an application can retrieve data from another application's API and use it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. 

The dashboard uses [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities.
